The Python tool (mirrored from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aupasana/aupasana/master/OSXScripts/dli.py) for convenience) is most feature-rich and up-to-date. This tool searches the Digital Library of India for books by barcode (on multiple mirrors), downloads the TIFF files from the best server, and then converts and combines them into a single PDF.

Dependencies: libtiff
Recommends: aria2
